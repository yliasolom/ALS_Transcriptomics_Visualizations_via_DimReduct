Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating neurological disease that affects 1 in 400 people. Patients suffer a progressive loss of voluntary muscle control leading to paralysis, difficulty speaking, swallowing and ultimately, breathing. Over 60% of patients with ALS die within 3 years of clinical presentation and 90% will die within 10 years. But there is reason for hope.

We stand at a very important time and place in our mission to end ALS. Biotechnologies are rapidly evolving to produce new sources of data and change the way we learn about the brain in health and disease. Answer ALS has generated an unprecedented amount of clinical and biological data from ALS patients and healthy controls. We need your help to analyze that data, increase our understanding of ALS and bring clarity to potential therapeutic targets.

Answer ALS, EverythingALS and Roche Canada's Artificial Intelligence Centre of Excellence is requesting the collaborative effort of the AI community to fight ALS. This challenge presents a curated collection of datasets from a number of Answer ALS sources and asks you to model solutions to key questions that were developed and evaluated by ALS neurologists, researchers, and patient communities.
